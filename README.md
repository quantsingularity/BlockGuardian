## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (v16+)
- Python (v3.9+)
- Go (v1.18+)
- Rust (latest stable)

### Setup Using Environment Script

The easiest way to set up the development environment is to use the provided setup script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/quantsingularity/BlockGuardian.git
cd BlockGuardian

# Run the setup script
./setup_blockguardian_env.sh

# Start the application
./run_blockguardian.sh
```

### Manual Setup for Individual Components

1. **Backend (`backend/`):**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Set up environment variables: `cp .env.example .env` and edit as needed
   - Run the development server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

2. **Mobile Frontend (`mobile-frontend/`):**
   - Navigate to the `mobile-frontend` directory: `cd mobile-frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
   - Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
   - Run on Android or iOS:
     ```bash
     yarn android # or npx react-native run-android
     yarn ios   # or npx react-native run-ios
     ```
3. **Web Frontend (`web-frontend/`):**
   - Navigate to the `web-frontend` directory: `cd web-frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Run in development mode: `npm run dev` (usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000`)
   - Build for production: `npm run build`
   - Start production server: `npm run start`

### Running the Entire Project (using Docker Compose)

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided at the root to simplify running the core services (backend, web-frontend). Other services like blockchain nodes or data analysis environments might need separate management or integration into the Docker Compose setup if desired.

```bash
# From the project root directory
docker-compose up --build
```

## Key Scripts

The repository includes several utility scripts to simplify common tasks:

- `setup_blockguardian_env.sh`: Sets up the development environment
- `run_blockguardian.sh`: Starts the application
- `lint-all.sh`: Runs linting on all code
- `validate_code_quality.py`: Validates code quality and security

## Testing

The project maintains comprehensive test coverage across all components to ensure reliability and security.
